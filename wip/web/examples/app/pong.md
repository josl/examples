# `:pong`

Source:

-   `/app/pong.hoon`

`:dojo` (you will need two running urbits to send and receive a message):

    ~your-urbit-1:dojo/examples> |start %pong

    ~your-urbit-2:dojo/examples> |start %pong

    ~your-urbit-1:dojo/examples> :pong &urbit ~your-urbit-2

<br />

This app demonstrates how to poke an app with an urbit name.

Start the app on two urbits in `:dojo` and send a pong to your second urbit from
your first urbit using the command above. Your second urbit should receive:

    [%pong 'Incoming pong!']
    [%pong %received 'Pong']

Let's briefly walk through what we just did:

-   We sent data of the `urbit` mark from dojo to the sender (your first
    urbit)'s `pong.hoon` app.

-   `mar/urbit` parses the data, and passes it to `++poke-urbit`

-   `++poke-urbit` then sends a move with the message 'Pong' to your second
    urbit.

-   Your second urbit received this data with its own `pong.hoon` app.
    `pong.hoon` parses it with `mar/atom`, and then receives it on the
    `++poke-atom` arm, which simply prints the message out.
