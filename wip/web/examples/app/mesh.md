`:dojo` (you will need three running urbits to demo a full `:mesh` social
network):

    ~your-urbit-1:dojo/examples> |start %mesh

    ~your-urbit-2:dojo/examples> |start %mesh

    ~your-urbit-3:dojo/examples> |start %mesh

`:mesh` is a simple distributed social network. The backend is a `%gall` app
written from scratch, and the frontend uses `D3.js` to render a force-directed
graph representing your `:mesh` network. `:mesh` is a reasonably complete demo
that works well to highlight how `%gall` apps make distributed state
synchronization a breeze for app developers, and how to serve reasonably complex
app data to the web to render with the frontend UI library of your choice.

Contained in your `:mesh` app state are: your social network, containing your
friends and friends-of-friends; and a HTML hex color that propagates to all of
your friends and colors a node that represents you on your and all of your
friends' graphs.

Load up your first urbit's web interface at the link above. The `:mesh` networks
of your urbit will start empty. "Friend" your second urbit by typing their name
in the text box and hitting `Enter` on your keyboard (don't forget `@p` syntax:
prefix the name/address with a `~`!).

After a seconds, a network graph should be drawn showing the new first-degree
connection, represented by a green line edge.

Both node colors default to grey. Click one of the six preselected color
options, or get fancy and set your own in the `:dojo` of your first urbit:

    ~your-urbit-1:dojo/examples> :mesh &mesh-color '#000000'  

Your first urbit's node on the graph should now be the new color. Now if you
load your second urbit's web UI at the second link above and "friend" your first
urbit back, the connection you make with them will display the correct updated
color. Change your second urbit's color, and the change will push to your first
urbit's UI in real time.

In your second urbit's UI, friend your third running urbit, which will create a
second first-degree connection in your second urbit's graph. But if you look
back in your first urbit's graph, the connection won't be direct; it will be
second-degree, as the third urbit is the friend of your friend, represented by a
blue line edge. Friending the third urbit directly will change this back to a
first-degree connection. Colors changes on any of the ships will propagate to
all subscribed friends and their friends.

Like `:feed`, the plan is to turn this example into a complete written-up
tutorial, but we wanted to share the code with everyone first. For the time
being, we're happy to answer questions in `:talk` or by a Github issue.
