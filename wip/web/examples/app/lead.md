This app is a basic leaderboard that allows you to add contestants and increment
their scores.

Start the app in `:dojo` and visit the web interface, then `Add` a name to the
leaderboard. It will be stored in the app's state.

Let's briefly trace what happens on each `Add`:

-   When you click 'Add', or when you increment a contestants score,
    `web/pages/lead.hoon` catches the event and sends that json information --
    more specifically data with the mark of `json`--to `app/lead.hoon`.

-   The `json` data is parsed by `mar/json.hoon`, and is then passed to
    `++poke-json` (in `app/lead.hoon`).

-   `++poke-json` reparses the `++json` to Hoon data structures, and updates the
    app's state to include the latest result.

-   Finally, `++poke-json` passes the updated state to `++deliver`, which sends
    the new state back to `lead.js`, whose callback passes it to React, where
    our DOM diff is calculated automatically.
