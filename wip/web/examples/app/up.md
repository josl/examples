# `:up`

Source:

-   `/app/up.hoon`

`:dojo`:

    ~your-urbit:dojo/examples> |start %up

    ~your-urbit:dojo/examples> :up &atom 'https://www.example.com'

    ~your-urbit:dojo/examples> :up &atom %on

<br />

This app continually pings a server at the 'target' URL.

Start the app from `:dojo`, set the URL you want to ping and set your 'pinger'
to `%on`. You should receive either:

    [%all-is-well 200]

or

    [%we-have-a-problem {status-code}]

Then, to turn the 'pinger' off:

    ~your-urbit:dojo/examples> :up &atom %off

Let's walk through what happened, step by step:

-   The first URL `:dojo` nouns was type-checked by `mar/atom.hoon` and
    converted into an atom.

-   The validated atom was then passed to the `++poke-atom` arm in the `up.hoon`
    app.

-   `++poke-atom` saves the text url as `target` in the app state.

-   We poked `up.hoon` again with the `%on` atom; `%on` also got type-checked
    and converted to an atom via `mar/atom.hoon` and got passed to
    `++poke-atom`. This time with the text `on`, this pinged the target url with
    an http request.

-   `++sigh-httr` receives the http response and displays the result. It then
    calls `++wake-timer`, telling it to wait 10 seconds before pinging the
    target url again. This process repeats until you poke the app again with
    `off`.
