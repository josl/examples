## Tumblr Urbit API integration

*Note* The Tumblr API docs do not accurately reflect all responses. I have
implemented the major keys of blog post responses, but there are some missing.
If you want the "reblog tag," you'll have to work for it ;)

Source:

-   `/app/tumblr.hoon`
-   `/mar/tumblr/blog-posts.hoon`
-   `/mar/tumblr/blog-post.hoon`
-   `/mar/tumblr/user-info.hoon`
-   `/sec/com/tumblr.hoon`
-   `/lib/jumblr.hoon`
-   `/lib/tumblr-parse.hoon`
-   `/lib/tumblr-parse.hoon`
-   `/sur/tumblr.hoon`
-   `/gen/tumblr/feed.hoon`

## Purpose

This app allows any Urbit app to connect to an authenticated Tumblr account. It
does this by asking you for your keys once and then keeping them in your Urbit.
Every subsequent call to that domain will use the same keys.

Below you will find the relevant setup instructions as well as the basic
commands that one can run.

## Setup

-   `|init-oauth1`
-   enter tumblr api endpoint `api.tumblr.com` and your consumer key and secret
    for [your app](https://www.tumblr.com/oauth/apps)
-   try `+https://api.tumblr.com/user/info`

## Connector commands

To see the information for the authenticated user

    :dojo> /+  tumblr
    :dojo> .^(user-info:tumblr %gx /=tumblr=/user/info/tumblr-user-info)

To see posts for a blog (not fully fleshed out yet)

    :dojo> /+  tumblr
    :dojo> .^((list post:tumblr) %gx /=tumblr=/blog/<identifier>/posts/tumblr-blog-posts)

To see all posts, you can also run the generator with either a blog identifier
or the `@t` 'dashboard'. The latter will show the latest posts from your
dashboard.

    :dojo> +tumblr/feed <identifier|'dashboard'>
