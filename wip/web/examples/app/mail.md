# `:mail`

Source:

-   `/app/mail.hoon`
-   `/mar/mail/message.hoon`
-   `/mar/mail/send.hoon`
-   `/sur/mail/message.hoon`
-   `/sur/mail/send.hoon`
-   `/web/pages/mail.hoon`

`:dojo` (you will need two running urbits to send and receive a message):

    ~your-urbit-1:dojo/examples> |start %mail

    ~your-urbit-2:dojo/examples> |start %mail

Web:

    http://localhost:8443/~~/pages/mail

    and

    http://localhost:8444/~~/pages/mail

This allows urbits to send typed, email-like message over the network.

Start the app on two urbits in `:dojo` and visit the web interfaces of both.
Fill out the `To` field in the page of your first urbit with the name of second
urbit (don't forget `@p` syntax: prefix the name/address with a `~`!).

Then, fill out the `Subject` and `Body` forms with text.

Click `Send`.

Your second urbit's console and web page should display the message!

Let's walk through what just happened:

-   When we click 'send', foos.js uses `urb.send` from `urb.js` to send our
    message as an 'mail-send' to the sending urbit's `mail.hoon` app.

-   `mar/mail/send.hoon` parses our message and passes it to the
    `++poke-mail-send` arm.

-   `++poke-mail-send` saves the message in the `sent` part of its state, then
    sends it with the current timestamp and sender -- as a `mail-message` -- to
    the `mail.hoon` app running on the other ship.

-   The other ship's `mail.hoon` parses our message with `mar/mail/message`,
    receiving it on the `++poke-mail-message` arm.

-   `++poke-mail-message` saves the received `mail-message` in its state, and
    then sends the updated version to the browser client for display.
